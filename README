With bukkit 1.7.2-R0.3 unit testing is impossible #51. Therefore I desided to
stop developing this plugin suite.

I may change my mind once bukkit becomes test friendly again, or another
Minecraft server implementation offers the tools needed to develop against.

=== ExpCraft ===
A reimplementation of the great LevelCraft plugin for Bukkit to add some
experience gathering to the game. There are implementations for Minecraft
versions since 1.8.1 for all basic plugins of the original LevelCraft but
the fighting plugins.

==== DEV Setup ====
Tools
- eclipse
- maven (plugin)
- git (console)

--- Setup ---
 1) Get Java JDK 1.6
 2) Get eclipse indigo from eclipse.org
 3) Get "Maven Integration for Eclipse" through the Eclipse Marketplace
 4) Create a UTF-8 workspace
 5) Branch ExpCraft into your workspace
 6) Open the workspace in eclipse
 7) Import the projects into eclipse workspace (Import existing maven project)

--- Compile order ---
 1) expcraft-core
 2) expcraft-testing
 3) all the other projects
The expcraft-testing project provides a mock of the core and therefore has 
to be compiled after the core but before any of the module projects.
If you use the launcher "all clean install", the order is correct.

Tips
- Use the preconfigured Launchers to build the projects
- Launchers may not work in certain eclipse/maven plugin constellations
- Source works for b1.7.2-R0.2
