Installation
-+----------
 |
 I Works with CraftBukkit server version ${bukkit.version}.
 |
 > Copy "ExpCraftCore.jar" and all the modules you want to use to
 | your bukkit's "plugins" folder.
 |
 > Run bukkit once to have ExpCraft and the modules generate their
 | default configuration files.
 |
 > Edit the files as you please. "plugins/ExpCraft/config/"
 |
 > Start bukkit for real.

Web GUI
-+-----
 |
 I If you store the progress in a MySQL database, you can use the
 | contents of "WebGui.zip" to display the stats on the net. You'll
 | need a web server and working PHP installation, together with a
 | working connection to the database.
 |
 > Just extract the content of the ZIP archive anywhere on your web
 | server.
 |
 > Rename config.php.default to config.php and set the database
 | connection right.
